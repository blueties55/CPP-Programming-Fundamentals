# CPP-Programming-Fundamentals
This repository will be updated with the code I write based on introduced topics in my C++ Programming Fundamentals class.


Any programs with a "Password" Will ALWAYS have the password set to "admin" all lower case. If that does not work check
caps lock or other methods of troubleshooting. Obviously you're welcomed to manually pull the password because it will be obvious in the code.
